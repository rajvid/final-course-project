## Website Proposal:

* For my final year project, I want to develop a blogging website and discussion forum. I am choosing this as my work because my husband does blog quite a bit often and is looking forward to making his own website for which I always wanted to help. The website will be on "Structural Engineering". It was the main reason I chose this certification course as I did not know anything about web-development. As of now I will be using posts resource and pages resource of blogger API, but as we move forward and know more about it, I can list them and present how I have utilized APIs in the web-design.
